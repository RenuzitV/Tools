Using a Mac can be hard for Windows users. This .md file is written using personal experience to increase productivity while using a Mac.

# Navigation 
Navigating in a Mac is quite different from using a Windows computer. As a Windows user, we are used to `alt-tab` our way to any window currently opened in our app. This works great, but sometimes we have a bit too much windows in our desktop (looking at you, 200-tabs-into-200-window Edge users)

Mac attempts to fix this by only showing icons of each application within our application when using `cmd-tab`, then we can switch between windows of the same application using ``cmd+\``

(Normally, people would just scroll 4 finglers to get this )

# Trackpad
Modern Mac trackpads require you to press firmly until the haptic touch sets in to register a left click, which you can disable via Settings -> find trackpad gestures -> untick force Click and haptic feedback. I personally did not untick it.

Also check out the More Gestures tab from the same settings group, which you can learn about how to navigate your Mac using your trackpad.

# Spotlight
Spotlight is a great way to quickly find and open apps without having to wait for you Dock (the thing that pops up when you move your mouse down the bottom of the screen), or opening the Applications folder using Finder, or scrolling through endless apps in your Launchpad. 

## Setting up shortcut alias for your apps
Sometimes opening up Chrome, Slack or Firefox can be time consuming when typing in Spotlight. You can open Finder, go to the Applications folder, find your app, right click and create an Alias. Spotlight can find that alias and open it up like a shortcut.

I personally use `ffx` for Firefox so I can type it using my left hand only.


# Raycast
Raycast is also an amazing tool to quickly navigate apps, and open quick links to your browser. Think of it like fast dial in your Nokia.

After installing Raycast, open it up and find "Create Quicklink". You can then make an alias for a website, say, github.com/your-org/your-repo as `ghyr`, then typing `ghyr` + `enter` automatically makes a new tab in your preferred browser to that link. Neeeat.

You can even put variables to these shortcuts to further customize them. I personally think they are too "nerdy"
