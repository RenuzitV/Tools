# Centralized config for tools that I use

 *Do not, my friend, become addicted to full-fledged IDEs. It will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence. - Immortan Joe*

# Quick Start
look at `/vsc` for vscode configs, profiles, shortcuts, etc.

look at `/tools` for tools I use and recommend

look at `Mac.md` for some guidance for new Mac users

## For setting up nvim:
call `make setup` to copy these configs to your local machine, or `make copy` to copy your local machine's config to this directory's `nvim` folder

**I don't personally use nvim anymore. See README in nvim folder for reason**
